            <h2>Dear Adelia,</h2>
            <p>Happy, happy birthday, my love! 🎉 Today is such a special day because twenty years ago, the most wonderful person I’ve ever known was born—you. And now, I get the absolute privilege of celebrating this day with you, the person who has completely stolen my heart.</p>
            <p>It’s crazy to think that you’re stepping into your twenties now. A whole new decade of life, experiences, and memories waiting ahead of you. And through it all, I want to be right here by your side, cheering you on, holding your hand, and loving you just as much—if not more—than I already do.</p>
            <p>I honestly can’t put into words how much you mean to me. From the moment we started this journey together, you’ve brought nothing but happiness into my life. You are my safe place, my biggest source of joy, and the person I look forward to talking to every single day. Every little thing about you—your laugh, your voice, the way you say my name, the way you get excited over small things, and even the way you pout when you don’t get your way—makes my heart melt.</p>
            <p>I love calling you all those little names—Pudel, Bibu, Biu, Babe, Sayang, Cutie, Cantikku, Sayangku, Imutku—because each one holds a different piece of my affection for you. They’re not just words; they’re reminders of how much you mean to me and how deeply I cherish you.</p>
            <p>These past nine months have been some of the best months of my life. We’ve shared laughter, silly moments, deep conversations, and everything in between. I’ve seen you at your happiest, I’ve seen you at your most vulnerable, and through it all, my love for you has only grown stronger. You are the most beautiful person I know—not just in the way you look (which, let’s be honest, you’re absolutely stunning), but in the way you think, care, and love.</p>
            <p>There are so many things I admire about you. Your kindness, your patience, your determination, your ability to light up any room you walk into. You make the world a better place just by being in it. And I’m so incredibly lucky that I get to love you and be loved by you.</p>
            <p>Now that you’re officially 20, I hope you enter this new chapter of your life with excitement and confidence. I know that whatever you set your mind to, you’ll accomplish, because you are one of the most amazing people I know. No matter where life takes you, I’ll be here, always supporting you, always believing in you, and always loving you.</p>
            <p>On your special day, I hope you feel as loved as you truly are. I hope you smile a lot, eat all your favorite food, and enjoy every second of today. You deserve nothing but happiness, and I promise to do everything I can to make sure you always have it.</p>
            <p>Happy 20th birthday once again, my love. Here’s to many more birthdays together, to more laughter, more love, and more memories that we’ll cherish forever. I love you so much, and I always will. ❤️</p>
            <p>Forever yours,</p>
